# CS-305-Software-Security-2025

1) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial, and they wanted to update their operations by improving their web-based software. They asked us to review their system for security vulnerabilities to help protect their data and ensure their software was secure.

2) What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

When I found security vulnerabilities, I started by understanding what each vulnerability affected and figuring out how to fix it. Coding securely is really important because it helps prevent hacking, data breaches, and other security issues, saving the company from potential headaches and expenses. Good security also reassures customers that their data is safe, which boosts the company's reputation and overall stability.

3) What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The Maven Dependency Check plugin was especially helpful when identifying vulnerabilities in the libraries and packages used in the code. It made it easier to see what needed updating or fixing.

4) How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security by updating outdated packages with Maven, switching to SHA-256 encryption for secure communication, and making sure all parts of the system were up to date. In the future, I would continue using tools like Maven Dependency Check to identify vulnerabilities, and I’d also do thorough testing to make sure everything works well before deploying.

5) How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I checked the security and functionality by running JUnit tests and performing Maven scans to find any new vulnerabilities. I also used the latest encryption standards and kept my code clean and consistent. After making changes, I reviewed everything carefully and ran tests again to ensure I didn’t accidentally add any new issues.

6) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used Eclipse as my IDE, which is great for Java development. The Maven Dependency Check plugin was really useful for spotting vulnerabilities. I also followed good coding practices like commenting my code clearly and using descriptive variable names to keep things organized.

7) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I could showcase my experience in using security tools like the Maven Dependency Check, implementing SHA-256 encryption for secure communication, creating certificates and keys, and working with APIs. This project demonstrates my ability to identify vulnerabilities, improve security, and write reliable, secure code.
